# omni-scrape

This is a repository for a new ruby gem called omni_scrape \n

# description

This gem is meant to be an all purpose web crawler and scraper.  My current focus for its development will be as follows.

1. Successfully follow links from first page and scrape. -done

2. Store scraped information as html docs.  -done note: Handles 404 errors for bad links.

3. Allow for a partial-url to be passed. -done

4. Scrape main page and replace links to redirect to generated html then store as html.

5. Create file structure for storing the html. 

6. Provide recursive depth implementation for more specified crawling.

7. Link page to local html docs as they are scraped and stored.

8. Manage duplication of stored documents.
