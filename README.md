5. Handle both internal and external links. -done

6. Scrape main page and replace links to redirect to generated html then store as html. -done

7. Create file structure for storing the html.  -done

8. Provide recursive depth implementation for more specified crawling. -done

9. Link page to local html docs as they are scraped and stored. -done

9. Manage duplication of stored documents. -done

10. Provide methods for explicitly internal and explicitly external links.

11. Provide method for just scraping initial page.
